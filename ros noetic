    Publisher: A node that sends messages to a topic.
    Subscriber: A node that receives messages from a topic.
    Messages: Data structures (usually defined in .msg files) that are sent over topics. They can contain various data types, including standard types (like integers and strings) and custom types.

How Topics Work

    Publisher Node: A node publishes messages to a specific topic. Multiple nodes can publish to the same topic.
    Subscriber Node: A node subscribes to a specific topic to receive messages. Multiple nodes can subscribe to the same topic.
    ROS Master: Keeps track of all active topics and nodes, allowing nodes to find each other and establish communication.
 nodes talk over a topic
one node publishes to a topic(message) and one node subscibes to a topic
topic is like a transmission channel between nodes
publisher nodes sends messages over a topic
subsciber node listens or recieves messages over at topic
rostopic list == gives list of topics running
rosmsg show 'topicname' == gives the variables and datatypes being used over the topic by the publisher
rostopic info 'topicname' == gives publisher and subscriber node info for a topic
rostopic echo 'topicname'==show the data passing through a topic
